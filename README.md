In 2020, the Covid-19 virus plagued the world, triggering lockdowns and public restrictions, causing impacts to global economies never before seen. While the effects of this pandemic are well known, we will look at prevalence of the disease and reactions by the government in order to examine the impact to air travel, 
economic performance, and how recovery efforts are progressing. Using data from various sources, we will review trends leading up to and through the pandemic (2019-2022). We will also analyze 2020 across different milestones that occurred in the US response to the ongoing pandemic.

## Did government actions have an impact on the disease and did those impacts translate to changes in economic performance

The stay at home orders chart demonstrate that there was a significant increase in the number of mandatory stay-at-home orders implemented in the second quarter of 2020, with many states and territories implementing these orders during this period. By the third quarter of 2020, most states had moved to advisory orders.

COVID-19 cases per quarter show a steady increase of covid cases during 2020. There is a decline in the beginning of 2021 as vaccines are made widely available then a sharper increase towards the end of 2021 and beginning of 2022. There is a decline in 2022 which may indicate more immunity but could also be a result of the distribution of at-home test kits to the public (announced March 2022)

## How was air travel impacted overall and regionally by the pandemic?

Around April to May of 2020 flights dropped from over 1.5 million per month in January 2020 to a little over 600,000 flights which relates to the time stay at home orders and travel hesitancy. Regions that saw the greatest impact were the Far West and Southeast which include popular travel destinations such as Las Vegas, Hawaii and Florida.

Flights returned to near normal levels of over a million flights per month by around June 2020 then rose during Q4 in 2020 to Q2 in 2021 peaking at almost 2 million flights per month which may relate to the spike in COVID-19 cases around the same time.

## Which industries and areas have experienced the most change since the pandemic?

Industries that were heavily impacted in Q2 of 2020 were Food Services and Drinking Places, Accommodations, Amusements & Gambling, Arts & Entertainment, Motion Picture & Sound Recording, Water-Truck-Rail-Air & Passenger Transportation, Motor Vehicles & parts, Petroleum products, and Mining & Extraction.<br>
NonDefense Spend rose the most in Q2 of 2020 by 21.2% while Air Transportation declined the most in Q2 of 2020 by -71.1%. Q2 results for NonDefense Spend and Air Transportation are likely due to the need to secure income and basic needs for those not working during mandatory shutdowns and the travel restrictions put in place during that time.<br>
Accommodation rebounded the most in Q3 of 2020 by 78.3% while NonDefense Spend declined the most in Q3 of 2020 by -8.8%. Q3 results for Accomodation and NonDefense are likely due to the lifting of travel restrictions allowing for workers to resume operations.

## Were there differences in performance regionally across the US?

Utah experienced the smallest decline in Q2 of 2020 at -14.1% while Nevada experienced the largest decline in Q2 of 2020 at -49.6%.<br>
Michigan experienced the largest rebound in Q3 of 2020 at 65.9% while Alaska experienced the smallest rebound in Q3 of 2020 at 14.2%

Nevada, Hawaii, and Louisiana all took 4 quarters for GDP to exceed Q1 of 2020 while 17 states recovered in only 1 quarter’s time. This slow recovery is likely due to the economy in those states’ reliance on industries that were heavily impacted by COVID-19 restrictions such as travel, accommodation, entertainment, food service and drinking places, and mining/oil/gas extraction and related products and services.

Michigan was one of the quickest recovering states and also showed the largest rebound in Q3 of 2020. The composition of Michigan’s economy consists of only 6.4% of industries heavily impacted by COVID-19. In contrast, heavily impacted industries make up 21.5% of Nevada’s economy.
